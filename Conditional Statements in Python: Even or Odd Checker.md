# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program T reads two numbers (real and imaginary parts) and prints the complex number.

Algorithm:

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Read real and imaginary parts.
2.Create a complex number using complex().
3.Print the complex number.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```.py
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=complex(a,b)
print(c)
```

## Output

## Result
The program reads the real part (5) and the imaginary part (7).

The program creates a complex number using Pythonâ€™s complex() function, which results in (5+7j).

Finally, it prints the complex number in the desired format.
