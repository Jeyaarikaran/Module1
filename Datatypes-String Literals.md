# Python basics -The following expression as true or false.


## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To evaluate the given logical and arithmetic expressions and print their results as either True, False, or the computed value.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm :
1.Expression a: Check if 0 is equal to True using the expression a = (0 == True).

2.Expression b: Check if False is equal to False using the expression b = (False == False).

3.Expression c: Add two True values using the expression c = True + True. Since True is equivalent to 1, it results in 1 + 1 = 2.

4.Expression d: Add False (which is equivalent to 0) and 9 using the expression d = False + 9, resulting in 0 + 9 = 9.

5.Print Results: Output the results of all four expressions in the required format.

## ðŸ§¾ Program :
```.py
a = (0 == True)

b = (False== False)

c = True + True

d = False + 9

print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```

## Output :
